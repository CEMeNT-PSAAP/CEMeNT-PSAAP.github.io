<p>Several production-scale multigroup Thermal Radiation Transport (TRT) codes use the Monte Carlo method as their primary solution technique. One such example is Jayenne from Los Alamos National Lab, which samples a single energy group for a particle then transports it [1]. In this work we created a novel TRT variance-reduction method to better resolve the energy spectra with large group structures and fewer particles, with a goal to decrease computational time at a given fidelity of solution in the energy spectra.</p>
