<p>At Oregon State since 2020.</p>

<p>Aaron Reynoldsâ€™ research interests include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>methods development for reactor analysis</li>
  <li>multiphysics coupling using multilevel projective approaches</li>
</ul>

<p>His efforts at CEMeNT focus on development of a time-dependent hybrid deterministic/Monte Carlo method to be used on modern computing architectures.</p>

<p>Prior to working with CEMeNT, Reynolds worked with Oak Ridge National Laboratory developing control rod depletion and fuel performance modeling capabilities in the the Virtual Environment for Reactor Applications.
In his dissertation research, a multilevel nonlinear projective method in cylindrical geometry was developed for circulating fuel reactor kinetics.</p>
