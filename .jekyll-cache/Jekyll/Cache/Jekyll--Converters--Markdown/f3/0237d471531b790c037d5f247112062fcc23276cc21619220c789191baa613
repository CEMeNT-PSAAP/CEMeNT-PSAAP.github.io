I"%<p>We have been included in NNSAâ€™s Annual Academic Programs report. The article explains the importance of the CEMeNT FIC to the NNSA Laboratories through the development of dynamic Monte Carlo neutron transport simulations. As well as the implementation of those methods on the exascale using GPU and CPU based supercomputers.</p>

<p>We are honored to be listed among all those centers, institutions, and projects on the cutting edge, pushing into the wild blue yonder. Specifically with our fellow PSAPP-III centers we are exhilarated to be exploring the brave new world of exascale super computing.</p>
