## Bio

Jordan Northrop is a nuclear engineering graduate student at Oregon State University working with Dr. Camille Palmer and Dr. Todd Palmer to model and simulate a time dependent small modular reactor challenge problem using Monte Carlo and hybrid methods. Previous work includes modeling the pulsed sphere benchmark problems for CEMeNT, modeling pulsed neutron die away experiments for LLNL, and using fission matrix methods to model TRIGA reactor pulses as an intern for the Westinghouse Fellows Program.
