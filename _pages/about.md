The Center for Exascale Monte Carlo Neutron Transport (CEMeNT) is a PSAAP-III Focused Investigatory Center led by Oregon State University, with partner institutions Notre Dame University and North Carolina State University. The goal of the center is to advance Monte Carlo neutron transport capabilities on problems relevant to the National Nuclear Security Administration's (NNSA) mission.

The project has three main thrusts in the areas of:
* Computational physics and simulation of time-dependent neutron transport phenomena
* Exascale Software Engineering
* Predictive Science

We are lead by Dr. Todd Palmer (Oregon State Univeristy) with researchers in nuclear engineering, computer science, software engineering, computational physics, and mathematics who are supported by seven graduate students and two Postdocs.
