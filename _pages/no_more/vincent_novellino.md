## Bio
Vincent is a graduate research assistant at North Carolina State University Department of Nuclear Engineering working towards his MS and PhD in nuclear engineering.
He is conducting research under Dr. Anistratov exploring hybrid methods for conducting Monte Carlo simulations for neutral particle transport problems.
Previous work includes comparing the two-step method to VERA, a high fidelity reactor modeling software, for PWRs fueled with HALEU fuel.
Interest include advanced reactor design, monte carlo methods for neutron transport problems, and reactor modeling and simulation.
