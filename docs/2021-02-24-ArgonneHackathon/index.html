<p>CEMeNT will be fielding two teams to participate in Argonne National Lab’s GPU Hackathon held April 27th - April 29th. The goal will be to push the development of two codes related to the center’s mission of developing dynamic monte carlo neutron transport simulations on the exascale. Utilization of GPUs is imperative in reaching the exascale threshold and this hackathon represents an amazing opportunity to work with Argonne’s experts who operate some of the largest supercomputers in the world.</p>

<p>The first team, codenamed DeNTests, will be lead by Dr. Aaron Reynolds, a post doctoral scholar in CEMeNT. The team is rounded out by graduate students Charles Goodman (Nuclear Engineering NCSU) and Kayla Clements (Nuclear Engineering OSU). They will be working on implementing Deterministic Neutron Transport (DeNT) using MFEM, a deterministic equation solver, on GPUs.</p>

<p>The second team lead fearlessly by Dr. Ilham Varaiansyah and will be working on his previously assembled Monte Carlo Dynamic Code (MC/DC) to enable operation on NVIDIA GPUs in the Python language using PyCUDA. The team is completed by graduate students Vincent Novellino (Nuclear Engineering NCSU), Sam Pasmann (Nuclear Engineering UND), Braxton Cuneo (Computer Science OSU), and Jackson Morgan (Mechanical Engineering OSU).</p>
