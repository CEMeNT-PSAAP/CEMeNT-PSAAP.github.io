Aaron Reynolds’ research interests include:     methods development for reactor analysis   multiphysics coupling using multilevel projective approaches   His efforts at CEMeNT focus on development of a time-dependent hybrid deterministic/Monte Carlo method to be used on modern computing architectures.   Prior to working with CEMeNT, Reynolds worked with Oak Ridge National Laboratory developing control rod depletion and fuel performance modeling capabilities in the the Virtual Environment for Reactor Applications. In his dissertation research, a multilevel nonlinear projective method in cylindrical geometry was developed for circulating fuel reactor kinetics.

His recent efforts included developing chemical-reaction mechanism reduction tools and algorithms for graphics processing units (GPUs) in order to enable the use of detailed, accurate chemical models in combustion simulations. Other research interests include computational modeling of multi-physics flows for applications in aerospace, transportation, and energy systems.   Biography  Kyle E. Niemeyer is an Associate Professor at the Oregon State University in the School of Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering. He leads the Niemeyer Research Group, which uses computational modeling to study various phenomena involving fluid flows, including combustion and chemical kinetics, and related topics like numerical methods and parallel computing. He is also interested in open access, open source, and open science in general, and has contributed in the area of standardizing research software citation. Kyle received his Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Case Western Reserve University in 2013, working with Jackie Sung and the Combustion Diagnostics Laboratory (now at the University of Connecticut). He received BS and MS degrees in Aerospace Engineering from Case Western Reserve University in 2009 and 2010, respectively.  ","categories": [],
