<p>CEMeNT will be fileding two teams to participate in Argonne National Lab’s GPU Hackathon held April 27th - April 29th. The goal will be to push the devlopemnt of two codes realted to the center’s mission of devloping dynamic monte carlo neutron transport simulations on the exascale. Utilization of GPUs is imparitive in reaching the exascale threshold and this hackathon represents an amazing opertunity to work with Argonne’s experts who operate some of the largest supercomputers in the world.</p>

<p>The first team, codenamed DeNTests, will be lead by Dr. Aaron Renyolds, a post doctoral schoolar in CEMeNT. The team is rounded out by graduate students Charles Goodman (Nuclear Engineering NCSU) and Kayla Clements (Nuclear Engineering OSU). They will be working on implementing Deterministic Neutron Transport (DeNT) using MFEM, a deterministic equation solver, on GPUs.</p>

<p>The second team lead fearlessly by Dr. Ilham Varaiansyah and will be working on his previously assembled Monte Carlo Dyanamic Code (MC/DC) to enable operation on Nvidia GPUs in the Python langauge using PyCUDA. The team is completed by graduate students Vincent Novellino (Nuclear Engineering NCSU), Sam Pasmann (Nuclear Engineering UND), Braxton Cuneo (Computer Science OSU), and Jackson Morgan (Mechanical Engineering OSU).</p>

<p>Stay tuned to see an update and recap of our progress made at this Hackathon</p>
